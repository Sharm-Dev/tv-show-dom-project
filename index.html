        <p>Lord Eddard Stark, ruler of the North, is summoned to court by his old friend, King Robert Baratheon, to serve as the
          King's Hand. Eddard reluctantly agrees after learning of a possible threat to the King's life. Eddard's bastard son
          Jon Snow must make a painful decision about his own future, while in the distant east Viserys Targaryen plots to
          reclaim his father's throne, usurped by Robert, by selling his sister in marriage.</p>
